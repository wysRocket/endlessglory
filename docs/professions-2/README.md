# Professions 2.0 planning packet

The phased implementation plan for completing the professions system as
approved in the 2026-07-16 maintainer brainstorm: six deep crafts with
pair-named archetypes, station masters in the open world, deterministic
crafting with celebrated masterworks, gathering with rare events, an economy
that pays skillers without touching raid loot, and a wheel window at Book of
Deeds quality. Built on epic #1866 and PR 2039.

Each phase runs as its own fresh Claude Code session (Opus 4.8, xhigh effort;
`ultracode` where a phase says so). Start a phase by pasting its starter prompt
from the phase file. Every implementation phase is followed by its QA phase.

## Reading order for a new session

1. `state.md`: locked decisions, validation matrix, current phase pointer.
2. `progress.md`: status table and deliverable checklists.
3. Your phase file below.

Do not read the whole packet into a session; spawn an Explore agent per the
starter prompt.

Waves for orientation: phases 1 to 7 are the fun kernel (visibility, truth,
and the first taste of identity); phases 8 to 15 are wave one (stations,
content, quests, polish). End of Phase 7 is the vertical-slice checkpoint:
the Phase 7 QA session plays the eight-step journey end to end (gather a
rare event, craft, watch skill move, receive the Guild letter, visit the
letter's named quest giver and attune via the quest flow (smith_haldren
stands in until the Phase 8 masters land), celebrate a masterwork, trade
it) before wave one begins. Ordering relief: Phase 6 depends on Phases 2
and 4, NOT on Phase 5, so it may run ahead of the wheel window if the
design-language rollout stalls Phase 5 (the state.md OPEN item).
Wave 2+ work (market instance carriage, the commission ORDER workflow,
Jack of All Trades, monster proficiency, battlefield experience) is
tracked on epic #1866, not in this packet; salvage wiring moved INTO
Phase 13 by the 2026-07-17 design-review amendments recorded in state.md,
and the 2026-07-20 timing and economy amendments inserted Phases 12b
(Gathering rhythm) and 14b (Commissions and the Maker's Bond) without
renumbering; the SECOND 2026-07-20 block (mastery and provenance)
inserted Phases 12c (The Mastery Curve) and 12d (Provenance and the
harvest loop) after the 12b QA; the state.md amendments blocks are the
authority for all three passes.
