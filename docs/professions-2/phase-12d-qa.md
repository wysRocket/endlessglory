# Phase 12d QA: Verify Provenance and the harvest loop

Audits the Phase 12d diff: the identical-payload merge at all four points, counted
instanced stacks across every consumer, the provenance surfaces, the unified
loot-and-harvest flow against the verified corpse lifecycle, mail expiry, and the two
companion bug fixes.

## QA Starter Prompt

```
This is Phase 12d QA of the Professions 2.0 feature: verify Provenance and the harvest
loop.
Model: Opus 4.8, xhigh effort. Harness: Claude Code.
Goal: audit the Phase 12d diff for correctness, missing tests, determinism, three-host
parity, i18n completeness, and inventory-integrity safety.

STEP 0 - PRE-FLIGHT: run git status; the tree must be clean; stop if dirty with work you
did not create. Memory scan (MEMORY.md index): node25-breaks-jsdom-gate, the professions
packet entries, big-diff-reviewer-turn-budgets (hard tool budgets + report-first for
every spawned reviewer).

STEP 1 - LOAD CONTEXT (do NOT read planning docs directly): spawn one Explore agent to
read and summarize: docs/professions-2/state.md (the provenance rulings and the as-landed
Phase 12d surfaces entry), docs/professions-2/progress.md,
docs/professions-2/phase-12d-provenance-stacking.md including its as-landed lifecycle
block, and git diff <phase-start>..HEAD. The summary must return: the deliverables and
acceptance criteria, the merge-rule symbols as landed, the verified corpse lifecycle as
recorded, every file touched, and the applicable validation rows.

STEP 2 - QA AUDIT: spawn parallel agents, each given ONLY the Explore summary, each with
a hard 30-tool-call budget and report-first framing:
- Inventory-integrity agent (the hardest charter): hunt dupes and losses around counted
  instanced stacks. Probe: partial-stack trades both directions; a trade where both sides
  offer same-payload stacks; removeItem end-backward consumption across a mixed
  plain/instanced inventory; enchant consumption from a counted stack; bank
  deposit-merge and withdraw-split; vendor sell of a counted stack; save/load and wire
  round trips; conservation must hold in every probe (count the items before and after).
- Lifecycle agent: drive loot-then-harvest, harvest-then-loot, denial of each half
  (tool tier, full bags), the town-focus default and picker override, claim races
  between two players, and respawn timing against the pinned state machine; a corpse
  that can strand or a respawn hostage to cleanup is BLOCKING.
- Provenance agent: Gathered by versus Crafted by across every signer source (node
  gather, corpse rare+, specimen, masterwork, enchant-carried); the marker on desktop
  and mobile shots; the downgrade notice fires on the exact full-bag boundary and never
  otherwise; the S3 guard.
- Companion-fix agent (as-landed scope, swept 2026-07-21): the filed #2139 overflow was
  ALREADY dead at phase start (the Phase 10 QA grant-order fix guards it); the phase
  pinned the hunted crossing case and made the signed-grant guards MERGE-AWARE
  (bags.ts canGrantItemInstance), so verify the pin bites and the merge arm keeps the
  signature at a full bag. Force-rename a character with signed items in its OWN blob
  (bags, bank, equipped eqi) and prove every signer string, the self-signed discount,
  and battlefield attribution follow the new name; mail escrow and market hold NO
  instances by construction, and foreign-held (trade-received) copies keep the stale
  name BY SCOPE (a flagged maintainer surface, not a defect).
- Mail agent: expiry at exactly the boundary, the single return cycle, deletion only
  after it, system-mail exemption by class (author a new system letter and prove it
  never expires without touching an id list), pre-existing mail clocks starting at
  deploy, and the full-mailbox return case.
Also spawn review agents per the Review Dispatch Matrix (cross-platform-sync for the
wire, privacy-security-review for the rename sweep, qa-checklist). COVERAGE, not
filtering; resume truncated agents.

STEP 3 - FIX: apply every BLOCKING and SHOULD-FIX finding test-first; rerun failed rows
until green; commit with explicit paths, Conventional Commits with a body.
- DIRECTED SHOULD-FIX (user, 2026-07-21, loot-window legibility; approved wording, land
  it in this QA pass): rename the loot window's "Take All" button to "Take Loot" (the
  old label promised the harvest too) and add tooltips to both buttons via the shared
  attachTooltip idiom, hover and mobile long-press alike:
  - Take Loot: "Takes the coins and dropped items. Does not use up the harvest."
  - Harvest: "Gathers the checked components. Each corpse can be harvested once, first
    come. Does not take the loot."
  Plus the footer hint line (approved, not optional): "The interact key loots and
  harvests in one press, using your town focus." on the loot window, the town-focus
  hint-line idiom. The new strings are wordy (M16):
  English catalog rows plus the five non-Latin overlay fills each. Pin the renamed
  label and both tooltip bindings; the Harvest button id/behavior is unchanged.

STEP 4 - UPDATE DOCS + MEMORY: progress.md QA row and verdict; state.md drift
corrections; append the QA post-inventory to the phase file's as-landed block; record
surprises to memory.

STEP 5 - FINAL RESPONSE FORMAT: verdict PASS / PASS-WITH-FOLLOWUPS / FAIL; findings by
severity, fixed versus deferred; deferrals with reasons; a one-line handoff to Phase 13.

STOPPING RULES: stop if any probe shows item duplication or loss (conservation is
non-negotiable); stop if a fix would require re-opening a locked provenance ruling; stop
if the tree is dirty with work you did not create.
