// deciding when two inventory slots of the same itemId may share a stack.
// Before Phase 12d every instanced slot (#1165) sat one-per-slot at count 1;
// now byte-equal payloads (same signer, same rolled quality/stats/masterwork,
// same enchant, same boundTo) merge up to the item's stack cap. bags.ts
// countFit/addStacked, Sim.addItemInstance, bank.ts moveBetweenContainers,
// and trade.ts fitsAfterSwap all consume canStackInstancePayloads below, so
// the merge rule cannot drift between bags, bank, and trade.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no rng, no clock
// (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). Pure bookkeeping, zero draws.
