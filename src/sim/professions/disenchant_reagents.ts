// Typed disenchant secondaries (Professions 2.0 Phase 13): the rare-or-better
// disenchant secondary material, keyed by the disenchanted piece's own material
// so an armor set and a weapon set feed distinct reagent lines. Armor keys off
// its armor class (cloth/leather/mail); a weapon keys off its family (a melee
// bucket yields steel, a caster/ranged haft-or-stock bucket yields timber).
// Below `rare` (and for a piece with no typed material, e.g. jewelry, which
// carries no armor class) there is no typed secondary, so the caller grants
// only the universal ladder material and stays byte-identical to the pre-Phase
// 13 yield.
//
// A pure `src/sim` leaf: no SimContext, no rng, no clock, no DOM/Three/render/
// ui/game/net imports (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). The
// resolveDisenchant arm (professions/enchanting.ts) reads this to decide the
// bind-on-trade secondary grant; the ENCHANTS table (content/enchants.ts)
// consumes each material so none is a dead-end.
